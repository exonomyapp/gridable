# upGrid - Style Guide

This document outlines the style guide for the `upGrid` component. It is based on Vuetify.

## Theming

The `upGrid` component supports a flexible theming system.

- A `theme` prop accepts a `upGridTheme` object.
- The `upGridTheme` interface (`../src/components/upGridTheme.ts`) defines the structure for controlling colors, borders, and other visual aspects of the grid.
- The theming system allows for easy customization to match the look and feel of any application.
