# upGrid - Product Plan & Progress

This document outlines the product plan and current progress for the `upGrid` component.

## I. Core Functionality (Completed)

This phase focused on establishing the foundational structure and core interactive features of the `upGrid` component.

- [x] **1. Foundational Grid Component:**
  - [x] Developed the core `UpGrid.vue` component.
  - [x] Implemented basic data rendering via `columnDefs` and `rowData` props.
  - [x] Added core features: sorting, pagination, and row selection (single and multiple).

- [x] **2. Advanced Interactivity & State Persistence:**
  - [x] Implemented robust column resizing.
  - [x] Implemented column reordering (drag & drop).
  - [x] Implemented column visibility toggling.
  - [x] Implemented per-column advanced filtering (text/number).
  - [x] Implemented inline cell editing.
  - [x] Developed a state management system to persist all UI customizations (column order, width, sort, filters, etc.). The grid accepts an `initialGridState` prop and emits a `grid-state-change` event.

- [x] **3. Theming Engine:**
  - [x] Implemented a flexible theming system via the `theme` prop, which accepts a `upGridTheme` object to control all visual aspects of the grid.

## II. Next Development Phase (Proposed)

This phase will focus on packaging the component for broader reusability and adding more advanced rendering capabilities.

### A. Packaging & Reusability

- [ ] **1. Package `upGrid` as an NPM Module:**
  - [ ] Refactor the component and its dependencies into a structure suitable for publishing as an independent npm package.
  - [ ] Define a clear public API and provide comprehensive documentation.
  - [ ] Set up a dedicated build process and implement unit and integration tests.
  - [ ] Publish the package to a registry.
  - [ ] Integrate the `upGrid` package back into the main Gridable application, replacing the local component.

### B. Advanced Features

- [ ] **2. Advanced Cell Rendering:**
  - [ ] Implement support for custom Vue components as cell renderers to display complex data (e.g., images, links, charts).

- [ ] **3. Performance Optimization:**
  - [ ] Investigate and implement strategies for handling very large datasets, such as virtual scrolling or data windowing, to ensure the grid remains performant.
