# upGrid - Product Plan

This document outlines the product plan for the `upGrid` component, a custom-built, feature-rich grid component.

## I. Initial Development Phase (Completed)

This phase focused on establishing the foundational structure of the `upGrid` component.

- [x] **1. Core UI Framework - Grid Component (Advanced):**
  - [x] Developed a foundational `UpGrid.vue` component using CSS:Grid (`../src/components/UpGrid.vue`).
  - [x] Implemented basic data rendering (props: `columnDefs`, `rowData`).
  - [x] Added features: sorting, pagination, basic column width/order/visibility concepts.
  - [x] Explicitly noted the goal to emulate AG Grid Enterprise features, with placeholders for advanced capabilities.
  - [x] Created a test page `pages/testing/grid-test.vue`.

- [x] **2. Theming Engine (Basic):**
  - [x] Implemented basic theming capabilities for `UpGrid.vue`.
  - [x] Added a `theme` prop and `upGridTheme` interface (`../src/components/upGridTheme.ts`) to control colors, borders, etc.
  - [x] Updated `grid-test.vue` with UI controls to demonstrate and test theme changes.

## II. Next Development Phase (Proposed)

This phase will focus on building out advanced features for the `upGrid` component.

### A. Core Functionality & Interactivity

- [x] **1. UpGrid.vue - Advanced AG Grid Features (Key UI interactions implemented):**
  - [x] Implement robust column resizing with persistence.
  - [x] Implement robust column reordering (drag & drop) with persistence.
  - [x] Implement basic advanced filtering (per column, text/number) with persistence.
  - [x] Implement column visibility toggle with persistence.
  - [x] Implement row selection (single, multiple) with programmatic access. (Implemented single, multiple modes with Ctrl/Cmd+click toggle, Shift+click range selection. Exposed methods for get/set/clear selection.)
  - [ ] Implement inline cell editing for data in tables (OrbitDB backend).
  - [ ] Investigate and implement strategies for handling large datasets (e.g., virtual scrolling, data windowing if OrbitDB supports it efficiently).
  - [ ] Support custom cell renderers (e.g., for displaying images, links, or custom Vue components within cells). (Basic checkbox renderer implemented).

### B. Componentization & Reusability

- [ ] **1. Package UpGrid as an NPM Module (`upGrid`):**
  - [ ] Refactor `UpGrid.vue` and its dependencies (like `upGridTheme.ts`, and potentially some base types) into a structure suitable for publishing as an independent npm package.
  - [ ] Define a clear public API for `upGrid`.
  - [ ] Set up a separate build process for the `upGrid` package (e.g., using Vite library mode or similar).
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for `upGrid`.
  - [ ] Publish `upGrid` to npm (initially as a private package if desired, or public).
  - [ ] **Integrate `upGrid` back into the main Gridable project**: Replace the local `../src/components/UpGrid.vue` with the imported `upGrid` package from npm.
  - [ ] Establish a workflow for developing and versioning `upGrid` alongside or independently of the main Gridable application.
