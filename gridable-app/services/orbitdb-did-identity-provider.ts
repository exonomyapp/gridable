/*
  How this would be used (conceptually):

  1. User Authentication:
     - User logs in via their DID method (e.g., wallet interaction).
     - Application gets access to their DID string and a way to request signatures (signingFunction).
     - Application also needs a way to verify signatures for this DID method (verificationFunction).

  2. OrbitDB Initialization:
     - const authStore = useAuthStore();
     - const did = authStore.currentUser.did;
     - const signingFunction = authStore.getSigningFunction(); // Provided by authStore
     - const verificationFunction = getDidVerificationFunction(); // Global or from a DID utility
     -
     - const identityProvider = new CustomDIDIdentityProvider({ did, signingFunction });
     -
     - const orbitdb = await createOrbitDB({
     -   ipfs: heliaNode,
     -   identity: identityProvider, // Pass the custom identity provider
     -   // ... other orbitdb options
     - });

  3. Access Controller:
     - The Access Controller (to be designed/selected in next step) would use:
       - `identityProvider.getId()` to get the DID of the user trying to write.
       - `CustomDIDIdentityProvider.verifyIdentity(signature, did, data, verificationFunction)` to check if an entry's signature is valid for the claimed DID.
